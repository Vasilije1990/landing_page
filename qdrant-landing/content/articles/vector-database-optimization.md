## Configure Indexing for Faster Searches

![indexing](/articles_data/vector-search-filtering/payload-index-filtering.png)

**What is it?** A vector index is the central location where Qdrant calculates vector similarity. It is the backbone of your search process, retrieving relevant results from vast amounts of data. 

Qdrant uses the **HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graph) algorithm** as its dense vector index, which is both powerful and scalable.

**Figure 2:** A sample HNSW vector index with three layers. Follow the blue arrow on the top layer to see how a query travels throughout the database index. The closest result is on the bottom level, nearest to the gray query point.

![hnsw-vector-index](/articles_data/resource-optimization/hnsw-vector-index.png)

#### Vector Index Optimization Parameters

Working with massive datasets that contain billions of vectors demands significant resources—and those resources come with a price. While Qdrant provides reasonable defaults, tailoring them to your specific use case can unlock optimal performance. Here’s what you need to know.

The following parameters give you the flexibility to fine-tune Qdrant’s performance for your specific workload. You can modify them directly in Qdrant's [configuration](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/configuration/) files or at the collection and named vector levels for more granular control.

#### Edges per Node - the `m` parameter

This controls the number of edges in the graph. A higher value enhances search accuracy but demands more memory and build time. Fine-tune this to balance memory usage and precision.
    
#### Index Build Range - the `ef_construct` parameter

This parameter sets how many neighbors are considered during index construction. A larger value improves the accuracy of the index but increases the build time. Use this to customize your indexing speed versus quality.

You need to set both the `m` and `ef parameters` as you create the collection:

```python
client.update_collection(
    collection_name="{collection_name}",
    vectors_config={
        "my_vector": models.VectorParamsDiff(
            hnsw_config=models.HnswConfigDiff(
                m=32,
                ef_construct=123,
            ),
        ),
    }
)
```

#### Search Range- the `ef` parameter

This determines how many neighbors are evaluated during a search query. You can adjust this to balance query speed and accuracy.
    
The `ef` parameter is configured during the search process:

```python
client.query_points(
   collection_name="{collection_name}",
   query=[...]
   ),
   search_params=models.SearchParams(hnsw_ef=128, exact=False),
)
```

## Data Compression Techniques
![quantization](/articles_data/what-is-vector-quantization/astronaut-mars.jpg)

Efficient data compression is a cornerstone of resource optimization in vector databases. By reducing memory usage, you can achieve faster query performance without sacrificing too much accuracy. One powerful technique is **quantization**, which transforms high-dimensional vectors into compact representations while preserving relative similarity. Let’s explore the quantization options available in Qdrant.

#### Scalar Quantization

Scalar quantization strikes an excellent balance between compression and performance, making it the go-to choice for most use cases. 

This method minimizes the number of bits used to represent each vector component. For instance, Qdrant compresses 32-bit floating-point values (**float32**) into 8-bit unsigned integers (**uint8**), slashing memory usage by an impressive 75%.

**Figure 3:** The top example shows a float32 vector with a size of 40 bytes. Converting it to int8 format reduces its size by a factor of four, while preserving the original representation of the user data.

![scalar-quantization](/articles_data/resource-optimization/scalar-quantization.png)

#### Benefits of Scalar Quantization:

**Memory usage will drop:** Compression cuts memory usage by a factor of 4. Qdrant compresses 32-bit floating-point values (float32) into 8-bit unsigned integers (uint8).

**Accuracy loss is minimal:** Converting from float32 to uint8 introduces a small loss in precision. Typical error rates remain below 1%, making this method highly efficient.

**Best for specific use cases:** To be used with high-dimensional vectors where minor accuracy losses are acceptable.

#### Set it up as you create the collection:

```python
client.create_collection(
   collection_name="{collection_name}",
   vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=1536, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
   quantization_config=models.ScalarQuantization(
       scalar=models.ScalarQuantizationConfig(
           type=models.ScalarType.INT8,
           quantile=0.99,
           always_ram=True,
       ),
   ),
)
```
When working with Qdrant, you can fine-tune the quantization configuration to optimize precision, memory usage, and performance. Here’s what the key configuration options include:

- **type**: Specifies the quantized vector type (currently supports only int8).
- **quantile**: Sets bounds for quantization, excluding outliers. For example, 0.99 excludes the top 1% of extreme values to maintain better accuracy.
- **always_ram**: Keeps quantized vectors in RAM to speed up searches.

Adjust these settings to strike the right balance between precision and efficiency for your specific workload.

#### Binary Quantization

**Binary quantization** takes scalar quantization to the next level by compressing each vector component into just **a single bit**. This method achieves unparalleled memory efficiency and query speed, reducing memory usage by a factor of 32 and enabling searches up to 40x faster.

#### **Benefits of Binary Quantization:**

Binary quantization is ideal for high-dimensional datasets and compatible embedding models, where compression and speed are paramount. 

**Figure 4:** This method causes maximum compression. It reduces memory usage by 32x and speeds up searches by up to 40x.

![binary-quantization](/articles_data/resource-optimization/binary-quantization.png)

**Efficient similarity calculations:** Emulates Hamming distance through dot product comparisons, making it fast and effective.

**Perfect for high-dimensional vectors:** Works well with embedding models like OpenAI’s text-embedding-ada-002 or Cohere’s embed-english-v2.0.

**Precision management:** Consider rescoring or oversampling to offset precision loss. 

Here’s how you can enable binary quantization in Qdrant:

```python
client.create_collection(
   collection_name="{collection_name}",
   vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=1536, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
   quantization_config=models.BinaryQuantization(
       binary=models.BinaryQuantizationConfig(
           always_ram=True,
       ),
   ),
)
```
> By default, quantized vectors load like original vectors unless you set **always_ram** to True for instant access and faster queries.

## Scaling the Database 

![database](/articles_data/what-is-a-vector-database/vector-database-1.jpeg)

Efficiently managing large datasets in distributed systems like Qdrant requires smart strategies for data isolation. **Multitenancy** and **Sharding** are essential tools to help you handle high volumes of user-specific data while maintaining performance and scalability.

#### Multitenancy

**Multitenancy** is a software architecture where multiple independent users (or tenants) share the same resources or environment. In Qdrant, a single collection with logical partitioning is often the most efficient setup for multitenant use cases.

**Figure 5:** Each individual vector is assigned a specific payload that denotes which tenant it belongs to. This is how a large number of different tenants can share a single Qdrant collection.

![multitenancy](/articles_data/vector-database-optimization/multitenancy.png)

**Why Choose Multitenancy?**

- **Logical Isolation**: Ensures each tenant’s data remains separate while residing in the same collection.
- **Minimized Overhead**: Reduces resource consumption compared to maintaining separate collections for each user.
- **Scalability**: Handles high user volumes without compromising performance.

Here’s how you can implement multitenancy efficiently in Qdrant:

```python
client.upsert(
   collection_name="{collection_name}",
   points=[
       models.PointStruct(
           id=1,
           payload={"group_id": "user_1"},
           vector=[0.9, 0.1, 0.1],
       ),

       models.PointStruct(
           id=2,
           payload={"group_id": "user_2"},
           vector=[0.5, 0.9, 0.4],
       )
   ]
)
```

---

To ensure proper data isolation in a multitenant environment, you can assign a unique identifier, such as a **group_id**, to each vector. This approach ensures that each user's data remains segregated, allowing users to access only their own data. You can further enhance this setup by applying filters during queries to restrict access to the relevant data.

Learn More about [Multitenancy](/documentation/guides/multitenancy/)

#### Sharding

Sharding is a critical strategy in Qdrant for splitting collections into smaller units, called **shards**, to efficiently distribute data across multiple nodes. It’s a powerful tool for improving scalability and maintaining performance in large-scale systems. 

**Automatic Sharding:**

Qdrant simplifies sharding by enabling **automatic sharding** by default. Here’s how it works:

- **Even Data Distribution**: Points are distributed across shards using a **consistent hashing algorithm**, ensuring balanced load and uniform data placement.
- **Dynamic Shard Allocation**: The number of shards is automatically set to match the number of nodes in the cluster unless you specify a custom configuration.

This default mechanism ensures that your collections are efficiently partitioned, requiring minimal manual intervention while optimizing resource usage.

**Example:**

```python
from qdrant_client import QdrantClient, models

client = QdrantClient(url="http://localhost:6333")
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="my_collection",
    vectors_config=models.VectorParams(size=300, distance=models.Distance.COSINE),
    shard_number=6  # Specify number of shards
)
```

---

#### User-Defined Sharding:

**User-Defined Sharding** allows you to take control of data placement by specifying a shard key. This feature is particularly useful in multi-tenant setups, as it enables the isolation of each tenant’s data within separate shards, ensuring better organization and enhanced data security.

**Figure 6:** Users can both upsert and query shards that are relevant to them, all within the same collection. Regional sharding can help avoid cross-continental traffic.

![custom-sharding](/articles_data/vector-database-optimization/custom-sharding.png)

**Example:**

```python
client.create_collection(
    collection_name="my_custom_sharded_collection",
    shard_number=1,
    sharding_method=models.ShardingMethod.CUSTOM
)
client.create_shard_key("my_custom_sharded_collection", "tenant_id")
```

---

When implementing user-defined sharding in Qdrant, two key parameters are critical to achieving efficient data distribution:

1. **Shard Key**:
    
    The shard key determines how data points are distributed across shards. For example, using a key like `tenant_id` allows you to control how Qdrant partitions the data. Each data point added to the collection will be assigned to a shard based on the value of this key, ensuring logical isolation of data.
    
2. **Shard Number**:
    
    This defines the total number of physical shards for each shard key, influencing resource allocation and query performance.
    
Here’s how you can add a data point to a collection with user-defined sharding:

```python
client.upsert( collection_name="my_collection", 
points=[models.PointStruct(id=1111, vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3])], 
shard_key_selector="tenant_1" )
```

---

This code assigns the point to a specific shard based on the tenant_1 shard key, ensuring proper data placement.

Here’s how to choose the shard_number:

- **Match Shards to Nodes**: The number of shards should align with the number of nodes in your cluster to balance resource utilization and query performance.
- **Plan for Scalability**: Start with at least **2 shards per node** to allow room for future growth.
- **Future-Proofing**: Starting with around **12 shards** is a good rule of thumb. This setup allows your system to scale seamlessly from 1 to 12 nodes without requiring re-sharding.
- **Avoid Re-Sharding**: Re-sharding can be complex and requires creating a new collection, so it's best to plan ahead to minimize disruptions.

## Query Optimization
![qdrant](/articles_data/vector-search-filtering/scanning-lens.png)

Improving vector database performance is critical when dealing with large datasets and complex queries. By leveraging techniques like **query optimization**, **caching**, and **batch processing**, you can ensure fast response times and maintain efficiency even at scale.

#### Query Optimization

Optimizing your queries is key to improving both search efficiency and accuracy. Qdrant provides several powerful techniques for streamlining your queries:


#### 2. Projection

Projection allows you to select only the required fields in your query results. By limiting the output size, you can significantly reduce response time and improve performance.

**Example:**

```python
results = client.search( collection_name="my_collection", 
query_vector=[0.1, 0.2, 0.3], limit=10, 
with_payload={"include": ["category"]})
```

---

---

#### 3. Reranking

Reranking adjusts the order of search results based on additional criteria, ensuring the most relevant results are prioritized. You can [read more](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/search-precision/reranking-hybrid-search/#rerank) on this here.

Example:

```python
client.query_points(
        "collection-name",
       prefetch=prefetch, # Previous results
       query=late_vectors, # Colbert converted query
       using="colbertv2.0",
       with_payload=True,
       limit=10,
)
```

---

#### 4. Hybrid Search

Hybrid search combines **keyword filtering** with **vector similarity search**, enabling faster and more precise results. Keywords help narrow down the dataset quickly, while vector similarity ensures semantic accuracy.

![image1.png](/articles_data/resource-optimization/image1.png)

Fig. 3: Architecture of Hybrid Search

#### Caching Mechanisms

A cache is a high-speed, temporary storage mechanism that helps reduce query processing time by storing frequently accessed data. It’s particularly valuable in scenarios where identical or similar queries are repeatedly executed. Instead of querying the search engine, results can be fetched directly from the cache, saving time and computational resources.

#### Types of Caching

**Simple Cache:** A **simple cache** stores queries and their responses as **key-value pairs**, where the query serves as the key, and the response is the value. When a new query is received, the cache checks for an exact match. If a match is found, the cached response is immediately returned, avoiding a search operation. If no match is found, the query is processed through Qdrant, and the result is added to the cache for future use.

**Semantic Cache:** Unlike simple caching, a **semantic cache** focuses on **meaning** rather than exact matches. It uses similarity measures to match stored queries with incoming ones, retrieving relevant responses even if the queries are not identical. This method is particularly effective for vector-based searches where semantic meaning matters.

Here’s how we can build it:

```python
def check_cache(query_vector):
    for key, value in cache.items():
        cached_vector = np.array(key)
        similarity = cos_sim(query_vector, cached_vector)
        if similarity > 0.85:  # Threshold for semantic match
            return value  # Return cached result
    return None
```

---

Before sending a query to Qdrant, the system checks the query vector's similarity against cached vectors. If the similarity exceeds **85%**, the cached result is returned directly, bypassing the need for a database query. This approach reduces query latency while maintaining result relevance.

#### Batch Processing Optimization

Batch processing consolidates multiple operations into a single execution cycle, reducing transaction overhead and enhancing throughput. It’s an effective strategy for both data insertion and query execution.

- **Batch Insertions**: Instead of inserting vectors individually, group them into larger batches to minimize the number of database transactions and the overhead of frequent writes.

**Example:**

```python
vectors = [
   [.1, .0, .0, .0],
   [.0, .1, .0, .0],
   [.0, .0, .1, .0],
   [.0, .0, .0, .1],
   …
]
client.upload_collection(
   collection_name="test_collection",
   vectors=vectors,
)
```

---

This reduces write operations and ensures faster data ingestion.

- **Batch Queries**: Similarly, you can batch multiple queries together rather than executing them one by one. This reduces the number of round trips to the database, optimizing performance and reducing latency.

**Example:**

```python
results = client.search_batch(
   collection_name="test_collection",
   requests=[
       SearchRequest(
           vector=[0., 0., 2., 0.],
           limit=1,
       ),
       SearchRequest(
           vector=[0., 0., 0., 0.01],
           with_vector=True,
           limit=2,
       )
   ]
)
```

---

Batch queries are particularly useful when processing a large number of similar queries or when handling multiple user requests simultaneously.

## Storage: Disk vs RAM
![qdrant](/blog/qdrant-colpali/qdrant-colpali-1.png)

As your data scales, effective resource management becomes crucial to keeping costs low while ensuring your application remains reliable and performant. One of the key areas to focus on is **memory management**.

#### Memory Management

Understanding how Qdrant handles memory can help you make informed decisions about scaling your vector database. Qdrant supports two main methods for storing vectors:

#### 1. In-Memory Storage

- **How it works**: All vectors are stored in RAM, providing the fastest access times for queries and operations.
- **When to use it**: This setup is ideal for applications where performance is critical, and your RAM capacity can accommodate all vectors.
- **Advantages**: Maximum speed for queries and updates.
- **Limitations**: RAM usage can become a bottleneck as your dataset grows.

#### 2. Memmap Storage

- **How it works**: Instead of loading all vectors into memory, memmap storage maps data files directly to a virtual address space on disk. The system's page cache handles data access, making it highly efficient.
- **When to use it**: Perfect for storing large collections that exceed your available RAM while still maintaining near in-memory performance when enough RAM is available.
- **Advantages**: Balances performance and memory usage, allowing you to work with datasets larger than your physical RAM.
- **Limitations**: Slightly slower than pure in-memory storage but significantly more scalable.

To enable memmap storage in Qdrant, you can set the **on_disk** parameter to true when creating or updating a collection.

```python
client.create_collection(
   collection_name="{collection_name}",
   vectors_config=models.VectorParams(
      …
      on_disk=True
   )
)
```

---

**Choosing the Right Storage Method:**

- Use **in-memory storage** if:
    - You prioritize speed above all else.
    - Your dataset can comfortably fit in the available RAM.
- Opt for **memmap storage** if:
    - Your dataset is too large for in-memory storage.
    - You need a cost-efficient solution that balances performance and resource usage.

By selecting the right storage method for your application’s needs, you can scale efficiently while maintaining a balance between cost and performance. Whether you prioritize speed or resource optimization, Qdrant gives you the flexibility to adapt as your data grows.

#### Configuring Payload Storage

Qdrant provides two primary methods for storing payload data, offering flexibility to balance memory usage and performance based on your application’s needs:

#### 1. InMemory Storage

- **How it works**: Payload data is loaded into RAM during startup, ensuring fast access to the data.
- **When to use it**: Ideal for high-performance scenarios where sufficient RAM is available to handle the entire dataset.
- **Advantages**: Delivers the fastest query performance.
- **Drawbacks**: Memory consumption can become significant, especially for large payloads such as images or long text.

#### 2. OnDisk Storage

- **How it works**: Payload data is stored on disk using **RocksDB**, reducing RAM usage. Indexed fields are kept in memory for faster query performance.
- **When to use it**: Perfect for large datasets or when RAM availability is limited.
- **Advantages**: Conserves memory while providing reasonably fast access through techniques like page caching and indexing.
- **Drawbacks**: Slightly higher latency compared to InMemory storage.

Here’s how to configure OnDisk for payload:

```python
client.create_collection(
collection_name="{collection_name}",
on_disk_payload= True
)
```

---

The general guideline for selecting a storage method in Qdrant is to use **InMemory storage** when high performance is a priority, and sufficient RAM is available to accommodate the dataset. This approach ensures the fastest access speeds by keeping data readily accessible in memory. However, for larger datasets or scenarios where memory is limited, **Memmap** and **OnDisk storage** are more suitable. These methods significantly reduce memory usage by storing data on disk while leveraging advanced techniques like page caching and indexing to maintain efficient and relatively fast data access.

## Scaling Hardware
![qdrant](/blog/qdrant-colpali/qdrant-colpali-3.png)

When scaling a Qdrant cluster, selecting the right hardware is critical to achieving a balance between **RAM** and **disk storage**, tailored to the specific needs of your dataset. Here's how to approach it:

#### RAM vs. Disk

- **RAM**: Crucial for fast access to frequently used data, such as indexed vectors. The amount of RAM required can be estimated based on your dataset size and dimensionality. For example, storing **1 million vectors with 1024 dimensions** would require approximately **5.72 GB of RAM**.
- **Disk**: Suitable for less frequently accessed data, such as payloads and non-critical information. Disk-backed storage reduces memory demands but can introduce slight latency.

#### Disk Type

1. **SSD**: Recommended for optimal performance, particularly for workloads involving random reads and writes. SSDs can significantly enhance query response times when the data is stored on disk.
2. **HDD**: While more cost-effective, HDDs are slower and can negatively impact performance, especially for large datasets or applications requiring high-speed access.

#### Load Balancing

In a multi-node Qdrant deployment, **load balancing** ensures that traffic is distributed evenly across nodes, improving both availability and performance. This distributed deployment allows multiple nodes to share data and expand storage capacity, making it scalable for larger datasets and higher query loads.

Qdrant supports extensive customization through configuration files. To apply your custom settings, you need to provide a modified configuration file that Qdrant will use at runtime. The primary configuration file for Qdrant is located at:

```python
qdrant/config/config.yaml
```

---

You can override the default settings by mounting your custom configuration file to this path within the Qdrant container. Here’s an example of a YAML configuration [file](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant/blob/master/config/config.yaml) you can modify to suit your needs. To apply your custom configurations, mount your updated config.yaml file when starting the Qdrant container. Use the following Docker command:

```python
docker run -p 6333:6333 \
    -v $(pwd)/config.yaml:/qdrant/config/config.yaml \
    qdrant/qdrant
```

---

This setup ensures that your custom config.yaml file replaces the default configuration when Qdrant starts. To enable clustering, update the configuration file as follows:

```python
#config.yaml

cluster:
 enabled: true # Enable distributed mode
 p2p:
   port: 6335
 consensus:
   tick_period_ms: 100
```

---

In the Qdrant Cloud console, you can scale your cluster by clicking **"Scale Up"** to increase the cluster size beyond a single node. Qdrant Cloud will automatically configure the distributed mode settings for the added nodes. However, note that after creating two or more nodes, Qdrant does not automatically move data between nodes. For more details on managing data distribution, refer to the official [documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/guides/distributed_deployment/#making-use-of-a-new-distributed-qdrant-cluster).

In a cluster with three or more nodes, Qdrant automatically distributes read and write operations across nodes. This enhances throughput and resilience, ensuring the cluster continues functioning even if one node fails, as long as a majority of nodes remain operational.

## Monitoring the Database

![qdrant](/documentation/examples/agentic-rag-crewai-zoom/agentic-rag-2.png)

Continuous monitoring is essential for maintaining system health and identifying potential issues before they escalate. Tools like **Prometheus** and **Grafana** are widely used to achieve this.

- **Prometheus**: An open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit, Prometheus collects and stores metrics in a time-series database. It scrapes metrics from predefined endpoints and supports powerful querying and visualization capabilities.
- **Grafana**: Often paired with Prometheus, Grafana provides an intuitive interface for visualizing metrics and creating interactive dashboards.

Qdrant exposes metrics in the **Prometheus/OpenMetrics** format through the /metrics endpoint. Prometheus can scrape this endpoint to monitor various aspects of the Qdrant system.

For a local Qdrant instance, the metrics endpoint is typically available at:

```python
http://localhost:6333/metrics
```

---

Here are some important metrics to monitor:

| **Metric Name** |  | **Meaning** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| collections_total |  | Total number of collections |
| collections_vector_total |  | Total number of vectors in all collections |
| rest_responses_avg_duration_seconds |  | Average response duration in REST API |
| grpc_responses_avg_duration_seconds |  | Average response duration in gRPC API |
| rest_responses_fail_total |  | Total number of failed responses (REST) |

## Challenges & Solutions

![qdrant](/documentation/examples/multimodal-search/image-1.png)

Connecting the techniques discussed earlier to common challenges in managing vector databases can provide practical strategies to optimize performance and scalability. Here’s how you can tackle these challenges:

#### Excessive Memory Consumption

Large datasets, particularly vector data, can lead to significant memory usage, straining resources and degrading system performance.

**Solutions**:

- **Offloading Load from RAM to SSDs**: Extend memory capacity by storing data on SSDs, which offer a cost-effective way to reduce RAM reliance while maintaining reasonable access speeds.
- **Vector Quantization Techniques**: Compress vectors to lower memory requirements without compromising accuracy significantly. Techniques like scalar or product quantization can be particularly effective.
- **Indexing Parameter Optimization**: Adjust parameters such as the number of clusters or the indexing strategy to balance memory usage and system performance efficiently.

#### Managing Large Datasets

As the volume of vector data increases, storing and managing it across distributed nodes becomes challenging, often leading to slower data retrieval times and scaling issues.

**Solutions**:

- **Data Distribution Across Nodes**: Partition and distribute the dataset across multiple nodes in a cluster to enhance scalability and improve retrieval performance.
- **Load Balancing**: Distribute incoming requests evenly across nodes to ensure consistent performance and avoid overloading any single node.

#### Slow Performance and Timeouts

Performance bottlenecks during querying and retrieval can result in slow responses or timeouts, particularly in systems with poor optimization or inefficient storage methods.

**Solutions**:

- **Query Optimization**: Refine query structures and leverage approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) algorithms to reduce query latency and enhance response times.
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed data in memory to minimize the load on the database and speed up query execution.

#### Data Overlap

In multi-user environments, isolating user-specific data is crucial to ensure data security and prevent interference between users. However, managing this isolation across multiple nodes can lead to increased operational costs. To address this challenge, here are some effective solutions:

#### **Solutions:**

1. **Multitenancy**Implementing a **multitenancy architecture** allows user data to be efficiently isolated while sharing a common infrastructure. This approach minimizes redundancy by storing user data logically separated within the same system, reducing both resource usage and costs.
2. **Access Control Mechanisms**Enforcing robust **access control mechanisms** ensures that user data remains isolated, even within a shared infrastructure.

In this guide, we explored strategies to improve system efficiency without compromising data integrity or query accuracy. Here are the key takeaways to guide you in building a robust and scalable vector database system:

- **Leverage Scalar Quantization**: For most use cases, scalar quantization offers an excellent balance, achieving 4x compression with minimal accuracy loss. Pair this with SSDs instead of HDDs for optimal performance, especially in high-demand environments.
- **Optimize Queries and Insertions**: Boost efficiency by employing techniques like batch processing, hybrid search (combining keyword filtering with vector similarity), and caching for frequently repeated queries.
- **Future-Proof Scalability**: Start with 12 shards to accommodate growth seamlessly and use group IDs and filters to implement efficient multitenancy in large systems.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly monitor your system’s health using tools like Prometheus and Grafana. Analyze performance metrics and fine-tune parameters to maintain efficiency and responsiveness.

By following these recommendations, you can build a vector database system that is not only efficient and cost-effective but also scalable to meet your evolving needs. With the right strategies, your system will be ready to tackle the challenges of large datasets and high-performance requirements, keeping you ahead in this rapidly advancing field.

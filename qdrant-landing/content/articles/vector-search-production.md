## What Does it Take to Run Search in Production?

A mid-sized e-commerce company launched a vector search pilot to improve product discovery. During testing, everything ran smoothly. But in production, their queries began failing intermittently: memory errors, disk I/O spikes, and search delays sprang up unexpectedly. 

It turned out the team hadn't adjusted the default configuration settings or reserved dedicated paths for write-ahead logs. Their vector index, too large to fit comfortably in RAM, frequently spilled to disk, causing slowdowns. 

> Issues like these underscore how default configurations can fail spectacularly under production loads.

#### Who is This Guide For?

Whether you're planning your **first deployment** or looking to **improve an existing system**, this walkthrough will help you build resilient and high-performing vector search infrastructure.

You will learn how to successfully deploy and maintain vector search systems in production environments. 

Drawing from real-world experiences of our users, you'll discover practical techniques to avoid common pitfalls that have derailed many production deployments. 




## Setup and Configuration for Stable Cloud Deployments

Vector databases hinge on careful resource management. Without the right memory, CPU, and disk settings, your system might appear to function for small or moderate loads, but break down at scale. Sometimes the breakdown manifests as unpredictable latencies or partial search failures that are difficult to replicate. Other times, you'll see severe resource contention that saturates CPU usage.

> **"I keep running out of memory and my pods are being evicted."**

**The Issue ðŸ‘‰** *You haven't configured CPU/memory limits accurately, so your container ends up hitting resource caps under heavy load. This results in throttling or eviction.*

One common misconfiguration involves container resource limits in Kubernetes. Teams often underestimate how CPU requests, CPU limits, and memory limits interact with the database's actual usage patterns. If a container is throttled or evicted by Kubernetes, throughput drops and queries start to time out. Meanwhile, logs can become noisy, making it harder to diagnose the root cause.

Another overlooked factor is concurrency. If you haven't sized your thread pools and concurrency parameters properly, the database can generate far more threads than the hardware can handle. This leads to context switching overhead, CPU saturation, and slow disk writes. The solution is to tune concurrency in tandem with real hardware specs. If you operate in a cloud environment, that might mean reconfiguring instance types or adjusting auto-scaling triggers.

Telemetry plays a critical role in diagnosing these issues before they escalate. By collecting metrics such as search latency distribution, CPU usage, I/O throughput, and memory consumption, you gain visibility into how your system behaves under stress. For instance, if you see memory usage creeping up to 90% during indexing or search peaks, that's a red flag to scale vertically (bigger machines), horizontally (more nodes), or both.

A multi-node configuration adds complexity. If nodes don't have consistent memory or CPU provisioning, search queries can behave unpredictably, because different shards respond at different speeds. One enterprise software vendor saw their multi-node cluster occasionally drop queries after misconfiguring node roles. The cluster's leadership logic got tangled, and newly added nodes tried to replicate data incorrectly, resulting in partial or missing writes.

Additionally, ephemeral storage can cause major headaches. If you're running in a container orchestration platform, ephemeral volumes might vanish when a pod is rescheduled, causing partial data loss unless you explicitly configure persistent volumes. The fix involves carefully managing persistent volume claims (PVCs), ensuring your data directory is safe, and verifying that your write-ahead logs (WAL) are stored in a non-ephemeral location.

#### Thread Tuning and Container Resource Limits

Many teams discover too late that container orchestration systems will kill containers that exceed specified resource limits. If your vector database regularly spikes in memory usageâ€”for instance, during high-volume ingestion or large query expansionsâ€”your container can be evicted. The best approach is to set resource requests and limits higher than peak usage, or scale horizontally so you're not pushing any single node to its edge.

#### Telemetry and Early Detection

Setting up dashboards to monitor CPU usage, memory consumption, disk I/O, and indexing times is crucial. Without telemetry, issues go unnoticed until user-facing errors appear. With it, you can see memory creeping upward or disk queue length increasing, giving you an early warning that resources are insufficient.

Avoid such pitfalls by isolating storage paths, sizing memory to fit your index type, and configuring node roles explicitly. Update Kubernetes and cloud images often to prevent version conflicts.

âœ… Checklist Item: Set memory limits, WAL, and disk paths; update cloud/K8s images

**What to do:**
- **Configure resource requests/limits** in Kubernetes accurately for CPU and memory.
- **Assign node roles** explicitly in multi-node clusters and validate them in staging.
- **Keep write-ahead logs** on persistent storage, not ephemeral.
- **Use telemetry** to track memory usage, concurrency, and I/O.

## Scaling the Database 
![vector-search-production](/articles_data/vector-search-production/vector-search-production-1.jpg)

> A fast-growing SaaS platform added **hundreds of new customers overnight**, and suddenly their vector search infrastructure began to falter. 

Query latencies became inconsistent, and internal monitoring showed one node handling five times the load of any other. Investigations revealed that they had implemented a naive modulo-based sharding strategy that inadvertently funneled certain data segmentsâ€”popular with new signupsâ€”to a single node.

[**Sharding**](documentation/guides/distributed_deployment/) is at the heart of horizontal scaling. Doing it correctly demands an understanding of how data is distributed and queried. If the data is naturally partitioned (for example, by geography or customer ID range), you might want shards aligned with these partitions. Conversely, if queries always touch the entire dataset, you may need a more uniform random distribution.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Sharding**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

Another real-world scenario involved a research organization performing real-time ingestion at high speed while simultaneously serving queries. Their cluster used replication for fault tolerance. However, replica synchronization settings weren't tuned. The secondaries lagged behind the primary by tens of seconds. Some queries ended up hitting stale data, leading to user confusion. Over time, the replication backlog ballooned, straining network resources. The fix required careful adjustments to replication intervals and concurrency, plus adding more network bandwidth.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Replication**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Scaling Up, Down, and Cost Management

Cost is an integral factor in scaling. It's not always about scaling up: you might need to scale down during periods of lower usage to control costs. A streaming analytics startup, for instance, discovered that 90% of traffic arrived in bursts during daytime hours. Their nodes sat idle overnight, burning through their budget. By implementing auto-scaling policies based on CPU usage and queue depth, they managed to reduce costs by nearly 40%. Still, they had to handle scale-down events gracefully, draining active queries before shutting nodes down.

> **"One of my nodes is doing way more work than the others."**

*Your sharding strategy is naive, causing hot-spot shards that handle most of the traffic. Replicas might also be falling behind.*

In a cloud-native environment, ephemeral scaling can cause data distribution chaos if shards aren't rebalanced or if the system can't handle nodes entering and leaving rapidly. You need to design for elasticity, ensuring your cluster can adapt to ephemeral node lifecycles without losing data or causing performance spikes. This often means implementing robust rebalancing strategies, which shuffle shards or replicas around based on metrics like CPU usage, query load, or shard size.

A large media analytics company that scaled out by adding new nodes learned this the hard way. They spun up more nodes to handle a spike in user activity but forgot to reshard afterward. The new nodes were largely idle, while older nodes continued to strain under old shards. Automated rebalancing, triggered by shard size and query load, solved the imbalance.

#### Cluster Management and Observability

Scaling effectively requires continuous monitoring. You should track shard distribution, replication lag, node health, and query latencies across the entire cluster. Tools like distributed tracing or time-series databases can help you visualize these metrics at scale.

Leadership elections can be another hidden pitfall. If you're using a system that has a leader-based architecture, make sure your leadership election timeouts and health checks are well-tuned. One node that frequently flaps between healthy and unhealthy statuses can trigger repeated leadership elections, causing system-wide churn.

âœ… Checklist Item: Define node roles and validate sharding and replication

**What to do:**
- **Design your sharding strategy** around real data distribution and query patterns.
- **Tune replication** intervals and concurrency for real-time ingestion or large-scale analytics.
- **Implement auto-scaling** policies to handle peak and off-peak traffic.
- **Reshard** or rebalance data after scaling events.

## Ingestion and Indexing - Avoiding Pipeling Breakage
![vector-search-production](/articles_data/vector-search-production/vector-search-production-1.jpg)

> **"When I try to import a huge dataset, everything grinds to a halt."**

*I forgot to disable indexing during large-scale ingestion, and now CPU usage is off the charts. No retry or back-off logic is in place.*

A major fintech company decided to import 500 million transaction records to power a recommendation engine. Initially, ingestion soared at 10,000 records per second. But it slowed dramatically within an hour, to the point where other services timed out trying to connect. The culprit? Indexing was left on during ingestion, causing each write to trigger compute-heavy updates to the vector index.

Turning off indexing or delaying it until after the bulk load can yield massive performance gains. Another media company saw up to a 60% speed boost for high-volume imports by disabling indexing first, ingesting data, and then re-enabling indexing during low-traffic windows. However, this approach demands thorough planning: if your use case needs near-real-time search, you might not afford to disable indexing entirely.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Indexing**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Batch vs. Streaming Pipelines

Ingestion strategies often fall into two categories: batch and streaming. A gaming platform, for example, may ingest player data in real time to offer on-the-fly matchmaking. That requires partial but frequent index updates. Meanwhile, a news aggregator might ingest content in bulk every hour. Each approach comes with trade-offs:

- **Batch Ingestion:** High throughput, but data isn't immediately searchable until the batch completes. Often paired with disabled indexing.
- **Streaming Ingestion:** Data is indexed in near real time, supporting fresh results. However, it can be CPU-intensive.

Resilience is vital for both. If a streaming pipeline goes down or a batch pipeline fails mid-upload, you might end up with partially indexed data. Build retry logic and idempotent insertion processes to avoid duplicating records.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Points**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Schema Governance and Multitenancy

> **"My filters aren't working the same way every time."**

*Your payload schema is inconsistent across different data pipelines, so some fields are typed differently or missing altogether.*

One healthcare firm discovered the perils of inconsistent schemas. Various pipelines inserted medical records with slightly different metadata typesâ€”strings in one, integers in another. Filters broke silently. The fix involved strict schema governance, ensuring all payload fields had standardized types.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Payload**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

Another company tried to maintain thousands of collectionsâ€”one for each tenant. It seemed logical at first, but it ballooned resource usage. The vector database had to maintain separate indices and metadata for each collection, making memory management unwieldy. By consolidating tenants into a single collection with identifying payload fields, they improved query speed and decreased overhead. This approach is multitenancy done right.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Multitenancy**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Optimizing Write Buffers

Some vector databases allow you to adjust write buffer size. If the buffer is too small, frequent flushes to disk slow ingestion. If it's too large, you risk memory pressure. Monitoring buffer usage alongside ingestion speed helps you right-size these settings.

âœ… Checklist Items:
- Tune write buffers, validate schema, use multitenancy
- Choose the right index for your performance needs

**What to do:**
- **Disable indexing** during large batch uploads if immediate search isn't crucial.
- **Enforce schema** consistency across pipelines.
- **Balance batch vs. streaming** ingestion for your specific latency requirements.
- **Adopt multitenancy** instead of creating many collections.

## Search Performance - Tune for Quality and Quantity
![vector-search-production](/articles_data/vector-search-production/vector-search-production-1.jpg)

> **"Search got super slow after we added more vectors."**

*Sounds like your index or concurrency settings aren't tuned, so the system is hitting disk more often and pushing CPU to the limit.*

> **"We're burning through RAM like crazy."** 

*You skipped quantization for my massive dataset, causing enormous memory footprints and inconsistent performance.*

A startup in the customer support sector noticed intermittent latency spikes. Investigating further, they found that their index was too large to fit entirely in memory. Once the cache evicted parts of the graph, subsequent queries took much longer to load needed segments from disk. Upgrading memory solved part of the issue, but the real breakthrough came from quantizationâ€”reducing index size while keeping accuracy high enough for their use case.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Quantization**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Advanced Tuning of Search Parameters

> **"Our results aren't relevant enough, or they take too long to compute."** 

*You haven't tuned search parameters like `top-k`, or I'm not using hybrid search effectively, leading to inefficient or inaccurate results.*

Many vector databases expose tunable parametersâ€”like `top-k` (the number of results to retrieve) or `ef_search` (in approximate nearest neighbor algorithms). By carefully adjusting these, you can strike a better balance between performance and recall. For instance, a large social media analytics firm discovered that lowering `ef_search` from 400 to 200 reduced CPU usage by 30% while keeping search quality acceptable for most queries.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Search**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

Additionally, concurrency limits matter. Some queries might be extremely heavy if they combine complex filters with large top-k values. If your system runs too many of these queries in parallel, you can saturate CPU or memory. A more conservative concurrency limit can prevent meltdown under peak load.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Queries**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Hybrid Search in Depth

A B2B software vendor integrated vector embeddings (for semantic understanding) with classical keyword-based search. At first, they simply combined the two sets of results. However, certain queriesâ€”especially those with strongly indicative keywordsâ€”were overshadowed by vector similarity. By enabling a more sophisticated hybrid planner, they let the system weigh keyword matches more heavily when they provided strong signals, resulting in more relevant outcomes.

In hybrid search, cardinality estimation plays a huge role. If your system underestimates how many documents match certain keywords, it may rely too heavily on vector similarity. Conversely, if it overestimates, you can skip relevant vectors. Monitoring search queries with telemetry helps you see if your planner is skewed, letting you adjust weighting or other parameters.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Hybrid Queriesn**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Filter Performance and Payload Indices

A manufacturing tech company stored a wealth of product metadata for custom filtering. But they never created indices on these fields. Their queries would retrieve tens of thousands of vectors, then apply the filter. This approach brought their server to its knees at high load. By indexing fields, they pruned most documents before vector similarity was even invoked, slashing both compute and latency.

#### Quantization Strategies

Quantization remains one of the most powerful optimizations in vector search, especially for large datasets. Scalar quantization replaces floating-point vector components with lower-precision representations, often 8-bit or 16-bit. Product quantization divides vectors into sub-vectors, then quantizes each sub-vector independently.

Real-world results vary by domain. A natural language processing startup found that using 8-bit scalar quantization cut memory usage by over 60%, with only a minor dip in accuracy. Meanwhile, an image search company saw more benefit from product quantization because their embeddings had complex distribution patterns.

Quantization demands thorough testing, though. Overdo it, and recall can plummet. A balanced approach, with automatic fallback to full precision for mission-critical queries, may be warranted.

âœ… Checklist Items:
- Add payload indices for all searchable fields
- Enable hybrid planner and monitor cardinality
- Choose and configure quantization types

**What to do:**
- **Tune search parameters** like `top-k` and `ef_search` for your performance vs. recall needs.
- **Limit concurrency** for complex queries.
- **Use hybrid planners** that can weigh keyword and vector signals effectively.
- **Benchmark different quantization methods** to find the best trade-off.

## Backup and Snapshots - The Safety Net
![vector-search-production](/articles_data/vector-search-production/vector-search-production-1.jpg)

> **"I tried to restore a snapshot, and now everything's broken."**

*I never tested backups, so I only discovered version mismatches and partial/incremental backups missing data at the worst possible time.*

A digital publishing company operating on a multi-region cloud setup endured a catastrophic data center outage. They had backups, but never tested the restoration process. When they attempted to restore, they hit an index format mismatch, losing valuable time to manual patching and partial data retrieval. Another analytics firm saw snapshot creation severely degrade query performance during business hours. Their snapshot mechanism saturated CPU resources because compression was set too aggressively.

#### Full vs. Incremental Backups

Many vector databases allow both full and incremental backups. Full backups copy the entire dataset, including indexes and payload files. Incremental backups only capture changes since the last backup. In large deployments, full backups can be prohibitively large and time-consuming, whereas incremental backups are more feasible. However, they require careful coordination to ensure no data is missed.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Backups**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

An ad-tech company learned this lesson the hard way. They took incremental backups but didn't coordinate them with ingestion properly. Some newly inserted vectors never made it to the snapshot, causing data gaps. The fix involved quiescing (pausing) ingestion briefly or taking a consistent snapshot at a known checkpoint.

#### Operational Tips for Large Deployments

For extensive deploymentsâ€”tens of billions of vectorsâ€”you need to consider where backups are stored. Local disk backups are risky if the node itself fails. Cloud storage integration provides safer, more durable storage. Also, test the read bandwidth needed for restoration. Some systems inadvertently assume local disk speeds, so when you restore from slower cloud storage, it takes far longer than expected.

Automated validation scripts help ensure that every backup is restorable. These scripts can check index consistency, payload schema correctness, and version alignment. Finally, do not forget to store your index configuration (like quantization settings or HNSW parameters) along with the data itself.

âœ… Checklist Item: Schedule automated snapshots and run test restores

**What to do:**
- **Use incremental backups** for large deployments to minimize overhead.
- **Coordinate snapshots** with ingestion to maintain consistency.
- **Store backups off-node** (cloud storage, external volumes) for safety.
- **Regularly test restoration** to verify index format compatibility.

## Database Administration - Staying One Step Ahead
![vector-search-production](/articles_data/vector-search-production/vector-search-production-1.jpg)

> **"I had no idea something was wrong until it was too late."**

I wasn't monitoring CPU, memory, disk, or query performance, and security features like TLS or RBAC weren't set up.

Running vector search in production is ultimately about trust. You need to trust that data is correct, queries are fast, and failures are handled. Earn that trust by preparing your system with care and testing constantly. Don't let assumptions lingerâ€”challenge them early and often. That's how you build a system that scales, performs, and stays reliable.

#### Designing for Failure

> **"When one node crashed, our entire cluster went down."**

I never implemented chaos testing or designed for failover, so a single point of failure took out production.

The best production teams assume failures will happen. Vector systems, while powerful, often exacerbate existing architectural weaknesses. High concurrency or large memory footprints can reveal subtle misconfigurations more readily. By using chaos engineeringâ€”a practice of intentionally injecting failuresâ€”teams can observe how their search service responds to node outages, partial network failures, or sudden CPU spikes.

When you design for failure, you incorporate strategies like:
- **Graceful Node Shutdowns**: Draining incoming requests and reassigning shard leadership.
- **Redundant Data Paths**: Storing data on multiple persistent volumes so a single disk failure doesn't destroy the entire shard.
- **Load Tests**: Generating high concurrency or large queries to simulate real spikes.

#### Security and Compliance

While not always top-of-mind, security is vital. If you're handling sensitive user data, the vector database must be locked down. Implement TLS for data in transit, use encryption at rest for stored vectors, and configure role-based access control (RBAC) so only specific services can read or write data. A finance startup nearly exposed confidential user embeddings because their vector service was deployed without TLS in a shared cluster environment.

||
|-|
|[**Documentation: Security**](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/configuration/)|

#### Observability and Cost Trade-offs

Advanced observability can be expensive. High-cardinality metrics or full distributed tracing might strain budgets. Yet, the cost of not having them can be largerâ€”chasing unknown performance bugs or failing to detect issues until customers complain can cost engineering hours and damage user trust.

One company balanced cost by sampling traces only for slow queries, capturing the high-latency paths that needed analysis. They also aggregated metrics at a coarser granularity, focusing on 95th percentile latencies. This helped them keep telemetry costs under control while still providing insight into potential bottlenecks.

## Random Sampling

*Available as of v1.11.0*

In some cases it might be useful to retrieve a random sample of points from the collection. This can be useful for debugging, testing, or for providing entry points for exploration.

Random sampling API is a part of [Universal Query API](#query-api) and can be used in the same way as regular search API.

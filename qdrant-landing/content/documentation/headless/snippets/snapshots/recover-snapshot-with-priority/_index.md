### Snapshot priority

When recovering a snapshot to a non-empty node, there may be conflicts between the snapshot data and the existing data. The "priority" setting controls how Qdrant handles these conflicts. The priority setting is important because different priorities can give very
different end results. The default priority may not be best for all situations.

The available snapshot recovery priorities are:

- `replica`: _(default)_ prefer existing data over the snapshot.
- `snapshot`: prefer snapshot data over existing data.
- `no_sync`: restore snapshot without any additional synchronization.

To recover a new collection from a snapshot, you need to set
the priority to `snapshot`. With `snapshot` priority, all data from the snapshot
will be recovered onto the cluster. With `replica` priority _(default)_, you'd
end up with an empty collection because the collection on the cluster did not
contain any points and that source was preferred.

`no_sync` is for specialized use cases and is not commonly used. It allows
managing shards and transferring shards between clusters manually without any
additional synchronization. Using it incorrectly will leave your cluster in a
broken state.

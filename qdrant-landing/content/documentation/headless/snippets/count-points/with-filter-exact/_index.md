## Counting points

_Available as of v0.8.4_

Sometimes it can be useful to know how many points fit the filter conditions without doing a real search.

Among others, for example, we can highlight the following scenarios:

- Evaluation of results size for faceted search
- Determining the number of pages for pagination
- Debugging the query execution speed

## Sparse Vector Index

*Available as of v1.7.0*

Sparse vectors in Qdrant are indexed with a special data structure, which is optimized for vectors that have a high proportion of zeroes. In some ways, this indexing method is similar to the inverted index, which is used in text search engines.

- A sparse vector index in Qdrant is exact, meaning it does not use any approximation algorithms.
- All sparse vectors added to the collection are immediately indexed in the mutable version of a sparse index.

With Qdrant, you can benefit from a more compact and efficient immutable sparse index, which is constructed during the same optimization process as the dense vector index.

This approach is particularly useful for collections storing both dense and sparse vectors.

To configure a sparse vector index, create a collection with the following parameters:

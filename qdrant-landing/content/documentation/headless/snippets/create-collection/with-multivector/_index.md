There are two scenarios where multivectors are useful:

* **Multiple representation of the same object** - For example, you can store multiple embeddings for pictures of the same object, taken from different angles. This approach assumes that the payload is same for all vectors.
* **Late interaction embeddings** - Some text embedding models can output multiple vectors for a single text. 
For example, a family of models such as ColBERT output a relatively small vector for each token in the text. 

In order to use multivectors, we need to specify a function that will be used to compare between matrices of vectors

Currently, Qdrant supports `max_sim` function, which is defined as a sum of maximum similarities between each pair of vectors in the matrices.

$$
score = \sum_{i=1}^{N} \max_{j=1}^{M} \text{Sim}(\text{vectorA}_i, \text{vectorB}_j)
$$

Where $N$ is the number of vectors in the first matrix, $M$ is the number of vectors in the second matrix, and $\text{Sim}$ is a similarity function, for example, cosine similarity.

To use multivectors, create a collection with the following configuration:

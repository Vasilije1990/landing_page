### Context search

Conversely, in the absence of a target, a rigid integer-by-integer function doesn't provide much guidance for the search when utilizing a proximity graph like HNSW. Instead, context search employs a function derived from the [triplet-loss](/articles/triplet-loss/) concept, which is usually applied during model training. For context search, this function is adapted to steer the search towards areas with fewer negative examples.

We can directly associate the score function to a loss function, where 0.0 is the maximum score a point can have, which means it is only in positive areas. As soon as a point exists closer to a negative example, its loss will simply be the difference of the positive and negative similarities.

$$
\text{context score} = \sum \min(s(v^+_i) - s(v^-_i), 0.0)
$$

Where $v^+_i$ and $v^-_i$ are the positive and negative examples of each pair, and $s(v)$ is the similarity function.

Using this kind of search, you can expect the output to not necessarily be around a single point, but rather, to be any point that isnâ€™t closer to a negative example, which creates a constrained diverse result. So, even when the API is not called [`recommend`](#recommendation-api), recommendation systems can also use this approach and adapt it for their specific use-cases.

# Introducing Cloud RBAC: Secure Access to Qdrant Cloud

# Summary

Qdrant Cloud is introducing a new feature called Cloud RBAC (Role-Based Access Control), which enables you to manage permissions for your cloud resources with greater precision. This feature is designed to work seamlessly within the Qdrant Cloud console, ensuring that only authorized users have access to sensitive data and capabilities.

## **What does Cloud RBAC mean for me?**

Cloud RBAC ensures that every aspect of our platform is secure and governed by strict access controls. We are introducing this capability via a feature flag, allowing us to selectively enable Cloud RBAC for specific customers and sections of the cloud console before it becomes generally available. 

## What permissions can I expect?

 Cloud RBAC will be a rollout of RBAC capabilities for:

- Billing
- Identity and Access Management
- Clusters
- Hybrid Cloud
- Account Configuration

Cloud RBAC will also introduce an improved and overhauled UI for the existing Invites and User Management capabilities of Qdrant Cloud.
